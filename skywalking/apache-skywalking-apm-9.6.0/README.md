# Abstract
**SkyWalking** is an open source APM system, including monitoring, tracing, diagnosing capabilities for distributed system
in Cloud Native architecture.

* Distributed Tracing
  * End-to-end distributed tracing. Service topology analysis, service-centric observability and APIs dashboards.
* Agents for your stack
  * Java, .Net Core, PHP, NodeJS, Golang, LUA, Rust, C++, Client JavaScript and Python agents with active development and maintenance.
* eBPF early adoption
  * Rover agent works as metrics collector and profiler powered by eBPF to diagnose CPU and network performance.
* Scaling
  * 100+ billion telemetry data could be collected and analyzed from one SkyWalking cluster.
* Mature Telemetry Ecosystems Supported
  * Metrics, Traces, and Logs from mature ecosystems are supported, e.g. Zipkin, OpenTelemetry, Prometheus, Zabbix, Fluentd
* Native APM Database
  * BanyanDB, an observability database, created in 2022, aims to ingest, analyze and store telemetry/observability data.
* Consistent Metrics Aggregation
  * SkyWalking native meter format and widely known metrics format(OpenTelemetry, Telegraf, Zabbix, e.g.) are processed through the same script pipeline.
* Log Management Pipeline
  * Support log formatting, extract metrics, various sampling policies through script pipeline in high performance.
* Alerting and Telemetry Pipelines
  * Support service-centric, deployment-centric, API-centric alarm rule setting. Support forwarding alarms and all telemetry data to 3rd party.
