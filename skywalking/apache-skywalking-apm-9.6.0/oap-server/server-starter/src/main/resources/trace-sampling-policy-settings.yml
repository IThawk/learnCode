  # Default sampling rate that replaces the 'agent-analyzer.default.sampleRate'
  # The sample rate precision is 1/10000. 10000 means 100% sample in default.
  rate: 10000
  # Default trace latency time that replaces the 'agent-analyzer.default.slowTraceSegmentThreshold'
  # Setting this threshold about the latency would make the slow trace segments sampled if they cost more time, even the sampling mechanism activated. The default value is `-1`, which means would not sample slow traces. Unit, millisecond.
