The Spring Framework supports various Kotlin constructs, such as instantiating Kotlin classes
through primary constructors, immutable classes data binding, and function optional parameters
with default values.

Kotlin parameter names are recognized through a dedicated `KotlinReflectionParameterNameDiscoverer`,
which allows finding interface method parameter names without requiring the Java 8 `-parameters`
compiler flag to be enabled during compilation. (For completeness, we nevertheless recommend
running the Kotlin compiler with its `-java-parameters` flag for standard Java parameter exposure.)

You can declare configuration classes as
https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/nested-classes.html[top level or nested but not inner],
since the later requires a reference to the outer class.
