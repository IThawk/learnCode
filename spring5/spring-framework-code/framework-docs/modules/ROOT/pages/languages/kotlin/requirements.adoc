Spring Framework supports Kotlin 1.3+ and requires
https://search.maven.org/artifact/org.jetbrains.kotlin/kotlin-stdlib[`kotlin-stdlib`]
(or one of its variants, such as https://search.maven.org/artifact/org.jetbrains.kotlin/kotlin-stdlib-jdk8[`kotlin-stdlib-jdk8`])
and https://search.maven.org/artifact/org.jetbrains.kotlin/kotlin-reflect[`kotlin-reflect`]
to be present on the classpath. They are provided by default if you bootstrap a Kotlin project on
https://start.spring.io/#!language=kotlin&type=gradle-project[start.spring.io].

WARNING: Kotlin https://kotlinlang.org/docs/inline-classes.html[inline classes] are not yet supported.

NOTE: The https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-module-kotlin[Jackson Kotlin module] is required
for serializing or deserializing JSON data for Kotlin classes with Jackson, so make sure to add the
`com.fasterxml.jackson.module:jackson-module-kotlin` dependency to your project if you have such need.
It is automatically registered when found in the classpath.
