= Ahead of Time Support for Tests

This chapter covers Spring's Ahead of Time (AOT) support for integration tests using the
Spring TestContext Framework.

The testing support extends Spring's xref:core/aot.adoc[core AOT support] with the
following features.

* Build-time detection of all integration tests in the current project that use the
  TestContext framework to load an `ApplicationContext`.
  - Provides explicit support for test classes based on JUnit Jupiter and JUnit 4 as well
    as implicit support for TestNG and other testing frameworks that use Spring's core
    testing annotations -- as long as the tests are run using a JUnit Platform
    `TestEngine` that is registered for the current project.
* Build-time AOT processing: each unique test `ApplicationContext` in the current project
  will be xref:core/aot.adoc#refresh[refreshed for AOT processing].
* Runtime AOT support: when executing in AOT runtime mode, a Spring integration test will
  use an AOT-optimized `ApplicationContext` that participates transparently with the
  xref:testing/testcontext-framework/ctx-management/caching.adoc[context cache].

[WARNING]
====
The `@ContextHierarchy` annotation is currently not supported in AOT mode.
====

To provide test-specific runtime hints for use within a GraalVM native image, you have
the following options.

* Implement a custom
  {api-spring-framework}/test/context/aot/TestRuntimeHintsRegistrar.html[`TestRuntimeHintsRegistrar`]
  and register it globally via `META-INF/spring/aot.factories`.
* Implement a custom {api-spring-framework}/aot/hint/RuntimeHintsRegistrar.html[`RuntimeHintsRegistrar`]
  and register it globally via `META-INF/spring/aot.factories` or locally on a test class
  via {api-spring-framework}/context/annotation/ImportRuntimeHints.html[`@ImportRuntimeHints`].
* Annotate a test class with {api-spring-framework}/aot/hint/annotation/Reflective.html[`@Reflective`] or
  {api-spring-framework}/aot/hint/annotation/RegisterReflectionForBinding.html[`@RegisterReflectionForBinding`].
* See xref:core/aot.adoc#hints[Runtime Hints] for details on Spring's core runtime hints
  and annotation support.

[TIP]
====
The `TestRuntimeHintsRegistrar` API serves as a companion to the core
`RuntimeHintsRegistrar` API. If you need to register global hints for testing support
that are not specific to particular test classes, favor implementing
`RuntimeHintsRegistrar` over the test-specific API.
====

If you implement a custom `ContextLoader`, it must implement
{api-spring-framework}/test/context/aot/AotContextLoader.html[`AotContextLoader`] in
order to provide AOT build-time processing and AOT runtime execution support. Note,
however, that all context loader implementations provided by the Spring Framework and
Spring Boot already implement `AotContextLoader`.

If you implement a custom `TestExecutionListener`, it must implement
{api-spring-framework}/test/context/aot/AotTestExecutionListener.html[`AotTestExecutionListener`]
in order to participate in AOT processing. See the `SqlScriptsTestExecutionListener` in
the `spring-test` module for an example.
