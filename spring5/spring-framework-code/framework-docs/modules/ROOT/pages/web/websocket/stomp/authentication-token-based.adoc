= Token Authentication

https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security-oauth[Spring Security OAuth]
provides support for token based security, including JSON Web Token (JWT).
You can use this as the authentication mechanism in Web applications,
including STOMP over WebSocket interactions, as described in the previous
section (that is, to maintain identity through a cookie-based session).

At the same time, cookie-based sessions are not always the best fit (for example,
in applications that do not maintain a server-side session or in
mobile applications where it is common to use headers for authentication).

The https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455#section-10.5[WebSocket protocol, RFC 6455]
"doesn't prescribe any particular way that servers can authenticate clients during
the WebSocket handshake." In practice, however, browser clients can use only standard
authentication headers (that is, basic HTTP authentication) or cookies and cannot (for example)
provide custom headers. Likewise, the SockJS JavaScript client does not provide
a way to send HTTP headers with SockJS transport requests. See
https://github.com/sockjs/sockjs-client/issues/196[sockjs-client issue 196].
Instead, it does allow sending query parameters that you can use to send a token,
but that has its own drawbacks (for example, the token may be inadvertently
logged with the URL in server logs).

NOTE: The preceding limitations are for browser-based clients and do not apply to the
Spring Java-based STOMP client, which does support sending headers with both
WebSocket and SockJS requests.

Therefore, applications that wish to avoid the use of cookies may not have any good
alternatives for authentication at the HTTP protocol level. Instead of using cookies,
they may prefer to authenticate with headers at the STOMP messaging protocol level.
Doing so requires two simple steps:

. Use the STOMP client to pass authentication headers at connect time.
. Process the authentication headers with a `ChannelInterceptor`.

The next example uses server-side configuration to register a custom authentication
interceptor. Note that an interceptor needs only to authenticate and set
the user header on the CONNECT `Message`. Spring notes and saves the authenticated
user and associate it with subsequent STOMP messages on the same session. The following
example shows how register a custom authentication interceptor:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@Configuration
	@EnableWebSocketMessageBroker
	public class MyConfig implements WebSocketMessageBrokerConfigurer {

		@Override
		public void configureClientInboundChannel(ChannelRegistration registration) {
			registration.interceptors(new ChannelInterceptor() {
				@Override
				public Message<?> preSend(Message<?> message, MessageChannel channel) {
					StompHeaderAccessor accessor =
							MessageHeaderAccessor.getAccessor(message, StompHeaderAccessor.class);
					if (StompCommand.CONNECT.equals(accessor.getCommand())) {
						Authentication user = ... ; // access authentication header(s)
						accessor.setUser(user);
					}
					return message;
				}
			});
		}
	}
----

Also, note that, when you use Spring Security's authorization for messages, at present,
you need to ensure that the authentication `ChannelInterceptor` config is ordered
ahead of Spring Security's. This is best done by declaring the custom interceptor in
its own implementation of `WebSocketMessageBrokerConfigurer` that is marked with
`@Order(Ordered.HIGHEST_PRECEDENCE + 99)`.
