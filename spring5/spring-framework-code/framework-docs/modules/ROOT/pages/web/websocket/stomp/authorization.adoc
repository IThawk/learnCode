Spring Security provides
{docs-spring-security}/servlet/integrations/websocket.html#websocket-authorization[WebSocket sub-protocol authorization]
that uses a `ChannelInterceptor` to authorize messages based on the user header in them.
Also, Spring Session provides
https://docs.spring.io/spring-session/reference/web-socket.html[WebSocket integration]
that ensures the user's HTTP session does not expire while the WebSocket session is still active.
