= Performance

There is no silver bullet when it comes to performance. Many factors
affect it, including the size and volume of messages, whether application
methods perform work that requires blocking, and external factors
(such as network speed and other issues). The goal of this section is to provide
an overview of the available configuration options along with some thoughts
on how to reason about scaling.

In a messaging application, messages are passed through channels for asynchronous
executions that are backed by thread pools. Configuring such an application requires
good knowledge of the channels and the flow of messages. Therefore, it is
recommended to review xref:web/websocket/stomp/message-flow.adoc[Flow of Messages].

The obvious place to start is to configure the thread pools that back the
`clientInboundChannel` and the `clientOutboundChannel`. By default, both
are configured at twice the number of available processors.

If the handling of messages in annotated methods is mainly CPU-bound, the
number of threads for the `clientInboundChannel` should remain close to the
number of processors. If the work they do is more IO-bound and requires blocking
or waiting on a database or other external system, the thread pool size
probably needs to be increased.

[NOTE]
====
`ThreadPoolExecutor` has three important properties: the core thread pool size,
the max thread pool size, and the capacity for the queue to store
tasks for which there are no available threads.

A common point of confusion is that configuring the core pool size (for example, 10)
and max pool size (for example, 20) results in a thread pool with 10 to 20 threads.
In fact, if the capacity is left at its default value of Integer.MAX_VALUE,
the thread pool never increases beyond the core pool size, since
all additional tasks are queued.

See the javadoc of `ThreadPoolExecutor` to learn how these properties work and
understand the various queuing strategies.
====

On the `clientOutboundChannel` side, it is all about sending messages to WebSocket
clients. If clients are on a fast network, the number of threads should
remain close to the number of available processors. If they are slow or on
low bandwidth, they take longer to consume messages and put a burden on the
thread pool. Therefore, increasing the thread pool size becomes necessary.

While the workload for the `clientInboundChannel` is possible to predict --
after all, it is based on what the application does -- how to configure the
"clientOutboundChannel" is harder, as it is based on factors beyond
the control of the application. For this reason, two additional
properties relate to the sending of messages: `sendTimeLimit`
and `sendBufferSizeLimit`. You can use those methods to configure how long a
send is allowed to take and how much data can be buffered when sending
messages to a client.

The general idea is that, at any given time, only a single thread can be used
to send to a client. All additional messages, meanwhile, get buffered, and you
can use these properties to decide how long sending a message is allowed to
take and how much data can be buffered in the meantime. See the javadoc and
documentation of the XML schema for important additional details.

The following example shows a possible configuration:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@Configuration
	@EnableWebSocketMessageBroker
	public class WebSocketConfig implements WebSocketMessageBrokerConfigurer {

		@Override
		public void configureWebSocketTransport(WebSocketTransportRegistration registration) {
			registration.setSendTimeLimit(15 * 1000).setSendBufferSizeLimit(512 * 1024);
		}

		// ...

	}
----

The following example shows the XML configuration equivalent of the preceding example:

[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes"]
----
	<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
		xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
		xmlns:websocket="http://www.springframework.org/schema/websocket"
		xsi:schemaLocation="
			http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
			https://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd
			http://www.springframework.org/schema/websocket
			https://www.springframework.org/schema/websocket/spring-websocket.xsd">

		<websocket:message-broker>
			<websocket:transport send-timeout="15000" send-buffer-size="524288" />
			<!-- ... -->
		</websocket:message-broker>

	</beans>
----

You can also use the WebSocket transport configuration shown earlier to configure the
maximum allowed size for incoming STOMP messages. In theory, a WebSocket
message can be almost unlimited in size. In practice, WebSocket servers impose
limits -- for example, 8K on Tomcat and 64K on Jetty. For this reason, STOMP clients
(such as the JavaScript https://github.com/JSteunou/webstomp-client[webstomp-client]
and others) split larger STOMP messages at 16K boundaries and send them as multiple
WebSocket  messages, which requires the server to buffer and re-assemble.

Spring's STOMP-over-WebSocket support does this ,so applications can configure the
maximum size for STOMP messages irrespective of WebSocket server-specific message
sizes. Keep in mind that the WebSocket message size is automatically
adjusted, if necessary, to ensure they can carry 16K WebSocket messages at a
minimum.

The following example shows one possible configuration:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@Configuration
	@EnableWebSocketMessageBroker
	public class WebSocketConfig implements WebSocketMessageBrokerConfigurer {

		@Override
		public void configureWebSocketTransport(WebSocketTransportRegistration registration) {
			registration.setMessageSizeLimit(128 * 1024);
		}

		// ...

	}

The following example shows the XML configuration equivalent of the preceding example:

[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes"]
----
	<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
		xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"

		<websocket:message-broker>
			<websocket:transport message-size="131072" />
			<!-- ... -->
		</websocket:message-broker>

	</beans>

An important point about scaling involves using multiple application instances.
Currently, you cannot do that with the simple broker.
However, when you use a full-featured broker (such as RabbitMQ), each application
instance connects to the broker, and messages broadcast from one application
instance can be broadcast through the broker to WebSocket clients connected
through any other application instances.
