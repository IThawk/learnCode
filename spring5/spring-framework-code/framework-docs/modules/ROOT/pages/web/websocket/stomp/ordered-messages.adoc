= Order of Messages

Messages from the broker are published to the `clientOutboundChannel`, from where they are
written to WebSocket sessions. As the channel is backed by a `ThreadPoolExecutor`, messages
are processed in different threads, and the resulting sequence received by the client may
not match the exact order of publication.

If this is an issue, enable the `setPreservePublishOrder` flag, as the following example shows:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@Configuration
	@EnableWebSocketMessageBroker
	public class MyConfig implements WebSocketMessageBrokerConfigurer {

		@Override
		protected void configureMessageBroker(MessageBrokerRegistry registry) {
			// ...
			registry.setPreservePublishOrder(true);
		}

	}
----

The following example shows the XML configuration equivalent of the preceding example:

[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes"]
----
	<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
		xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
		xmlns:websocket="http://www.springframework.org/schema/websocket"
		xsi:schemaLocation="
			http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
			https://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd
			http://www.springframework.org/schema/websocket
			https://www.springframework.org/schema/websocket/spring-websocket.xsd">

		<websocket:message-broker preserve-publish-order="true">
			<!-- ... -->
		</websocket:message-broker>

	</beans>
----

When the flag is set, messages within the same client session are published to the
`clientOutboundChannel` one at a time, so that the order of publication is guaranteed.
Note that this incurs a small performance overhead, so you should enable it only if it is required.
