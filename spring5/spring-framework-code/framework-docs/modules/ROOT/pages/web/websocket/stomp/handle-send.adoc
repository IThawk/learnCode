= Sending Messages

What if you want to send messages to connected clients from any part of the
application? Any application component can send messages to the `brokerChannel`.
The easiest way to do so is to inject a `SimpMessagingTemplate` and
use it to send messages. Typically, you would inject it by
type, as the following example shows:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@Controller
	public class GreetingController {

		private SimpMessagingTemplate template;

		@Autowired
		public GreetingController(SimpMessagingTemplate template) {
			this.template = template;
		}

		@RequestMapping(path="/greetings", method=POST)
		public void greet(String greeting) {
			String text = "[" + getTimestamp() + "]:" + greeting;
			this.template.convertAndSend("/topic/greetings", text);
		}

	}
----

However, you can also qualify it by its name (`brokerMessagingTemplate`), if another
bean of the same type exists.
