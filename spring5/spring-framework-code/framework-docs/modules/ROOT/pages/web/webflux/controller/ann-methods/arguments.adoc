= Method Arguments

[.small]#xref:web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-methods/arguments.adoc[See equivalent in the Servlet stack]#

The following table shows the supported controller method arguments.

Reactive types (Reactor, RxJava, xref:web-reactive.adoc#webflux-reactive-libraries[or other]) are
supported on arguments that require blocking I/O (for example, reading the request body) to
be resolved. This is marked in the Description column. Reactive types are not expected
on arguments that do not require blocking.

JDK 1.8's `java.util.Optional` is supported as a method argument in combination with
annotations that have a `required` attribute (for example, `@RequestParam`, `@RequestHeader`,
and others) and is equivalent to `required=false`.

|===
| Controller method argument | Description

| `ServerWebExchange`
| Access to the full `ServerWebExchange` -- container for the HTTP request and response,
  request and session attributes, `checkNotModified` methods, and others.

| `ServerHttpRequest`, `ServerHttpResponse`
| Access to the HTTP request or response.

| `WebSession`
| Access to the session. This does not force the start of a new session unless attributes
  are added. Supports reactive types.

| `java.security.Principal`
| The currently authenticated user -- possibly a specific `Principal` implementation class if known.
  Supports reactive types.

| `org.springframework.http.HttpMethod`
| The HTTP method of the request.

| `java.util.Locale`
| The current request locale, determined by the most specific `LocaleResolver` available -- in
  effect, the configured `LocaleResolver`/`LocaleContextResolver`.

| `java.util.TimeZone` + `java.time.ZoneId`
| The time zone associated with the current request, as determined by a `LocaleContextResolver`.

| `@PathVariable`
| For access to URI template variables. See xref:web/webflux/controller/ann-requestmapping.adoc#webflux-ann-requestmapping-uri-templates[URI Patterns].

| `@MatrixVariable`
| For access to name-value pairs in URI path segments. See xref:web/webflux/controller/ann-methods/matrix-variables.adoc[Matrix Variables].

| `@RequestParam`
| For access to query parameters. Parameter values are converted to the declared method argument
  type. See xref:web/webflux/controller/ann-methods/requestparam.adoc[`@RequestParam`].

  Note that use of `@RequestParam` is optional -- for example, to set its attributes.
  See "`Any other argument`" later in this table.

| `@RequestHeader`
| For access to request headers. Header values are converted to the declared method argument
  type. See xref:web/webflux/controller/ann-methods/requestheader.adoc[`@RequestHeader`].

| `@CookieValue`
| For access to cookies. Cookie values are converted to the declared method argument type.
  See xref:web/webflux/controller/ann-methods/cookievalue.adoc[`@CookieValue`].

| `@RequestBody`
| For access to the HTTP request body. Body content is converted to the declared method
  argument type by using `HttpMessageReader` instances. Supports reactive types.
  See xref:web/webflux/controller/ann-methods/requestbody.adoc[`@RequestBody`].

| `HttpEntity<B>`
| For access to request headers and body. The body is converted with `HttpMessageReader` instances.
  Supports reactive types. See xref:web/webflux/controller/ann-methods/httpentity.adoc[`HttpEntity`].

| `@RequestPart`
| For access to a part in  a `multipart/form-data` request. Supports reactive types.
  See xref:web/webflux/controller/ann-methods/multipart-forms.adoc[Multipart Content] and xref:web/webflux/reactive-spring.adoc#webflux-multipart[Multipart Data].

| `java.util.Map`, `org.springframework.ui.Model`, and `org.springframework.ui.ModelMap`.
| For access to the model that is used in HTML controllers and is exposed to templates as
  part of view rendering.

| `@ModelAttribute`
| For access to an existing attribute in the model (instantiated if not present) with
  data binding and validation applied. See xref:web/webflux/controller/ann-methods/modelattrib-method-args.adoc[`@ModelAttribute`] as well
  as xref:web/webflux/controller/ann-modelattrib-methods.adoc[`Model`] and xref:web/webflux/controller/ann-initbinder.adoc[`DataBinder`].

  Note that use of `@ModelAttribute` is optional -- for example, to set its attributes.
  See "`Any other argument`" later in this table.

| `Errors`, `BindingResult`
| For access to errors from validation and data binding for a command object, i.e. a
  `@ModelAttribute` argument. An `Errors`, or `BindingResult` argument must be declared
  immediately after the validated method argument.

| `SessionStatus` + class-level `@SessionAttributes`
| For marking form processing complete, which triggers cleanup of session attributes
  declared through a class-level `@SessionAttributes` annotation.
  See xref:web/webflux/controller/ann-methods/sessionattributes.adoc[`@SessionAttributes`] for more details.

| `UriComponentsBuilder`
| For preparing a URL relative to the current request's host, port, scheme, and
  context path. See xref:web/webflux/uri-building.adoc[URI Links].

| `@SessionAttribute`
| For access to any session attribute -- in contrast to model attributes stored in the session
  as a result of a class-level `@SessionAttributes` declaration. See
  xref:web/webflux/controller/ann-methods/sessionattribute.adoc[`@SessionAttribute`] for more details.

| `@RequestAttribute`
| For access to request attributes. See xref:web/webflux/controller/ann-methods/requestattrib.adoc[`@RequestAttribute`] for more details.

| Any other argument
| If a method argument is not matched to any of the above, it is, by default, resolved as
  a `@RequestParam` if it is a simple type, as determined by
  {api-spring-framework}/beans/BeanUtils.html#isSimpleProperty-java.lang.Class-[BeanUtils#isSimpleProperty],
  or as a `@ModelAttribute`, otherwise.
