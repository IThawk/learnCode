= HTTP Interface Client

The Spring Frameworks lets you define an HTTP service as a Java interface with HTTP
exchange methods. You can then generate a proxy that implements this interface and
performs the exchanges. This helps to simplify HTTP remote access and provides additional
flexibility for to choose an API style such as synchronous or reactive.

See xref:integration/rest-clients.adoc#rest-http-interface[REST Endpoints] for details.
