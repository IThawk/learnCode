The `spring-test` module provides mock implementations of `ServerHttpRequest`,
`ServerHttpResponse`, and `ServerWebExchange`.
See xref:testing/unit.adoc#mock-objects-web-reactive[Spring Web Reactive] for a
discussion of mock objects.

xref:testing/webtestclient.adoc[`WebTestClient`] builds on these mock request and
response objects to provide support for testing WebFlux applications without an HTTP
server. You can use the `WebTestClient` for end-to-end integration tests, too.
