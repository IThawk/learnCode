To test code that uses the `WebClient`, you can use a mock web server, such as the
https://github.com/square/okhttp#mockwebserver[OkHttp MockWebServer]. To see an example
of its use, check out
{spring-framework-main-code}/spring-webflux/src/test/java/org/springframework/web/reactive/function/client/WebClientIntegrationTests.java[`WebClientIntegrationTests`]
in the Spring Framework test suite or the
https://github.com/square/okhttp/tree/master/samples/static-server[`static-server`]
sample in the OkHttp repository.
